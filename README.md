# Avionics-Fault-simulator
The Avionics Fault Simulator is a Python-based application designed to replicate real-time aircraft avionics system behavior. It features a graphical interface for visualizing flight and sensor data, simulating component faults, and analyzing system responses. Built with an event-driven logic flow and a Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) module, it enables fault detection, live logging, and realistic subsystem interaction.

This project serves as an educational and research tool for understanding avionics fault dynamics, system reliability, and data visualization in modern aircraft.
